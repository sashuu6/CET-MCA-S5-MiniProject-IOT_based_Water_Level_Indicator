# IOT Based Water Level Indicator

## Introduction

The IOT based Water Level Indicator is the mini project under MCA course. The user can get water level through mobile app. The project is well suited for the following scenario:-

1. one pump for all action; tank, sprinkler for farm and garden.
2. valve locking system (One valve at a time).
3. Use of moisture sensor for garden.
4. Time based watering for farm.
5. Need info on display, Android app.

The following image is the prototype of the project.

## Features

1. Realtime water level, pump status and value status.
2. Android app.
3. Manual remote control pump control.
4. Automatic sprinker system according to moisture content.
5. LCD display for showing status.
6. Show system log on Android app and Web app.

## Hardware modules

1. Main board module.
2. Water tank module.
3. valve switching module.

### Main board Module Components

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W
2. Relay (220V - 5V)
3. LEDs - 2 (Red & green)

### Water Tank Module Components

1. Touch pads - 5
2. Ultrasonic sensor - 1
3. Atmega328p - 1

### Valve Switching Components

1. Solenoid valve - 3
2. Atmega328p - 1

Notes:-

1. The communication between the modules is via I2C communication.
2. All the data is stored in firebase.

## Setup Development Environment

### Install Raspberry Pi Requirements

1. Install python3 requirements.
   `sudo pip3 install requirements.txt`

### System process settings

To make the python code run at boot as background. Follow the following steps:-

1. Edit rc.local as adminstrator.

   `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`

2. Add internetStatus.py python program to run at boot as background process along with astrik(&) symbol.

   `sudo python3 /home/pi/CET-MCA-S5-MiniProject-IOT_based_Water_Level_Indicator/diagnostics/main-board/internetStatus &`

3. Save the rc.local file.
4. Reboot
